                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The project work should include development of an application/system software. Students are
                            highly recommended to implement relevant algorithms, theories and concepts that they have
                            learned. The project should be practiced by following analysis, design, implementation and
                            testing phases. The project can be done in group with at most three members in each group. For
                            the implementation of the project, students can choose appropriate language technologies as per
                            comfort and skills. While implementing the project, students should be able to write their own
                            program modules rather than relying on predefined APIs or Plugins except in some unavoidable
                            circumstances.<br />

                            <h4>Phases of Project:</h4>
                            The following are the phases of project work:
                            <h5>1. Proposal Submission and Presentation:</h5> Students must submit and present project
                            proposal on 3rd to 4th week of start of the seventh semester.<br />
                            <h5>2. Mid-Term:</h5> Students must submit progress report and defend midterm progress of their
                            project work on the 10th to 11th week of the seventh semester.<br />
                            <h5> 3. Final Submission:</h5> Students must submit and defend the project work during last week of
                            the seventh semester but before final board examination. The final defense will include a
                            viva voice followed by a demonstration of the project. The final defense will be
                            conducted by an evaluation committee with an external from the university. Students
                            must have to submit the project final report to their respective department of
                            college/campus before at least 10 days of final defense date. The report should be 102
                            submitted in standard format as prescribed. The hard/soft copy of report should be made
                            available to the external before a week of presentation date.<br /><br />


                            <h4>Provision of Supervision:</h4>
                            The supervisor should be a regular faculty of the campus/college. The role of supervisor is to
                            provide appropriate guidance to the students throughout the project. A supervisor can supervise
                            at most three groups of the project in a section. The supervisor should rigorously supervise,
                            monitor, feedback and evaluate the project groups under his/her supervision.
                            <br /><br />

                            <b>  Roles and Responsibilities:</b><br /><br />
                            <b>- HOD/Coordinator:</b>  The role of HOD/Coordinator is to coordinate with supervisor,
                            internal examiner, external examiner and students. The HOD/Coordinator should monitor
                            the students’ project progress in coordination with the respective supervisors. The
                            HOD/Coordinator is responsible for arranging the proposal defense, midterm and final
                            defense. The HOD/Coordinator should participate and evaluate proposal defense,
                            midterm, and final defense.<br /><br />
                            <b> Project Supervisor:</b> - The role of project supervisor is to supervise students’ project
                            throughout the semester. The supervisor should rigorously feedback and guide the
                            students. Supervisor is to participate and evaluate proposal defense, midterm, and final
                            defense. The supervisor should monitor the progress of projects under supervision.<br /><br />
                            <b> - Internal Examiner:</b> The role of internal examiner is to evaluate the students’ project
                            during different evaluation phases of the project. The internal examiner should participate
                            and evaluate proposal defense, midterm, and final defense.<br /><br />
                            <b>- External Examiner:</b>   The role of external examiner is to evaluate the students’ project
                            during final defense evaluation. The examiner should participate and evaluate viva voce
                            and demonstration session during the final defense.<br /><br />
                            <b>- Student:</b> The role and responsibilities of student include development of the project,
                            project report preparation, and defending the project work throughout each evaluation
                            phases. Despite of project work being group work, each student should have equal role
                            and responsibilities in the project. Each student will be evaluated individually so student
                            should be able to demonstrate his/her contribution in the project work individually.
                            Students should maintain a log visits with their supervisors at different dates during their
                            work. The log should include technical feedbacks from their supervisors.

                            While writing above chapters students should avoid basic definitions. They should relate and
                            contextualize the above mentioned concepts with their project work.
                            Citation and Referencing:
                            The listing of references should be listed in the references section. The references contain the list
                            of articles, books, urls, etc. that are cited in the document. The books, articles, and others that are
                            studied during the study but are not cited in the document can be listed in the bibliography
                            section. The citation and referencing standard should be IEEE referencing standard. The text
                            inside the document should be cited in IEEE style. The IEEE referencing standard can be found
                            in the web.

                             Font size for the headings should be 16 for chapter headings, 14 for section headings, 12 for
                            sub-section headings. All the headings should be bold faced.
                            F. Figures and Tables
                             Position of figures and tables should be aligned center. The figure caption should be centred
                            below the figure and table captions should be centred above the table. All the captions
                            should be of bold face with 12 font size.107
